1.
	list currently loaded config options
2. 
	add symbolic link whichever works of the below:
		/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/xconf.d -> /etc/xconf/xconf.d
		/etc/X11/xconf.d/ -> /etc/xconf/xconf.d
	then link config files to /etc/xconf/xconf.d instead of /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d
3. 
	rename config files to XX-name.xconf.conf to keep track of xconf files as *.xconf.conf
